# mOISC-dRISC

This is an open source implementation of a multi-One Instruction Set Processor (mOISC) based on 14 instructions
for microcontroller applications. 

This repository comprises a basic compilation and translation toolchain from C source code compiled with LLVM and LLVM assembly to the
mOISC assembler. mOISC can be used for educational purposes or other research activities, for instance devising other architectures.

This software is *experimental*, we have not implemented all LLVM-IR commands, and it works for simple programs. This software is only a starting point
to devise more complex projects.

## Pre-Requisites

The software has been tested under MacOS with Darwin Kernel Version 20.5.0, and under CentOS Linux 7, Kernel 3.10.0-1160.25.1.el7.
To run the program you need the following software:

+ python3 ([download](https://www.python.org/downloads/))
+ gtkWave ([download](http://gtkwave.sourceforge.net))
+ llvm and clang version >= 9.0 ([download](https://llvm.org))
+ python3 modules: argparse (once python3 is installed run `python3 -m pip install argparse`)

## Compiling C source code

Compilation from C to binary files is achieved using `mc.py` and `m.py`. For ease of use we have created two scritps that compile
the code by running both programs in sequence.

All the source files can be placed in the `examples/` folder. 

Code can be compiled in OISC mode and in CISC mode.

### Compiling in CISC mode 

#### LLVM-IR compilation

To compile in CISC mode an example code `test_wave.c` run the following command,
```
./compile-cisc examples/test_wave ll
```
where `ll` stands for low-level and invokes compilation based on clang LLVM-IR output.
After compilation the following files will be generated: `test_wave.fasm` (assembly in CISC mode), `test_wave.uasm` (unlinked assembly in OISC mode),
`test_wave.sym` (symbol file for simulation), `test_wave.bin` (binary file for simulation), `test_wave.mif` (MIF file for FPGA programming),
`test_wave.ll` (LLVM-IR code generated by `clang` before low-level compilation). 

#### Assembly translation

To translate from known ISA architectures, run the following command,
```
./compile-cisc examples/test_wave arm
```
where `arm` identifies the ISA, in this example ARM. Supported ISA are `x86`, `riscv`, `arm`, `mipsel`.
After compilation the following files will be generated: `test_wave.fasm` (assembly in CISC mode), `test_wave.uasm` (unlinked assembly in OISC mode),
`test_wave.sym` (symbol file for simulation), `test_wave.bin` (binary file for simulation), `test_wave.mif` (MIF file for FPGA programming),
`test_wave.<ARCH>` (`<ARCH>` assembly generated by `clang` and `llc` before translation). 


### Compiling in OISC mode 

#### LLVM-IR compilation

To compile in OISC mode an example code `test_wave.c` run the following command,
```
./compile examples/test_wave ll
```
where `ll` stands for low-level and invokes compilation based on clang LLVM-IR output.
After compilation the following files will be generated: `test_wave.asm` (assembly in OISC mode),
`test_wave.sym` (symbol file for simulation), `test_wave.bin` (binary file for simulation), `test_wave.mif` (MIF file for FPGA programming),
`test_wave.ll` (LLVM-IR code generated by `clang` before low-level compilation). 

#### Assembly translation

To translate from known ISA architectures, run the following command,
```
./compile examples/test_wave arm
```
where `arm` identifies the ISA, in this example ARM. Supported ISA are `x86`, `riscv`, `arm`, `mipsel`.
After compilation the following files will be generated: `test_wave.asm` (assembly in OISC mode),
`test_wave.sym` (symbol file for simulation), `test_wave.bin` (binary file for simulation), `test_wave.mif` (MIF file for FPGA programming),
`test_wave.<ARCH>` (`<ARCH>` assembly generated by `clang` and `llc` before translation). 

## Simulating the compiled code

To run graphical simulation (internally invoking gtkWave), run the following command:
```
./simulate examples/test_wave
```
Press ctrl-c to stop simulation execution. The simulation will generate a VCD file that will be opened by the `simulate` script in 
gtkWave.

## Generation of the mOISC VHDL code

To generate processor VHDL code and Quartus project files, run the following command:
```
./autogen examples/test_wave
```
The program will generate a full Quartus project in a subfolder `quartusrtl.out`, including only the 
instructions used in the assembly code. Make sure the code is compiled in OISC mode. The generated processor
will be able to run both CISC and OISC mode code in any case, but `autogen` will process only OISC mode assembler files.

To generate a full featured processor run:
```
./autogen examples/test_wave -mkfull
```
It will generate a full featured processor in a subfolder `quartusrtl.out.full`. In this case the OISC mode assembly is dummy.

### Note on commands syntax

The mOISC toolchain is based on `m.py`, `mc.py` and `mautogen.py`, that are called in the scripts `compile`, `compile-cisc`, `simulate` and `autogen`.
For instance, run the command `python3 m.py -help` to print the options of `m.py`. All these programs refer to the subfolder `\lib` and all its files.
